Subject: skip test that depends on the server implementation

Origin: vendor
Forwarded: no
Last-Update: 2023-11-30

With mariadb 10.5, the server doesn't seem to create a new entry in
prepared_statements_instances, at least not for "SELECT 1". In any case,
having a test that depends on the server side implementation does not look
like a good idea.
