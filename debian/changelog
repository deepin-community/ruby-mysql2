ruby-mysql2 (0.5.3-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Fix connection with test server (Closes: #978251)
    - debian/start_mysqld_and_run.sh: run server as $USER, and not as root.
      It seems that for some reasons mariadb no longer accepts connections
      as root.
    - debian/start_mysqld_and_run.sh: fallback to killing the server at the
      end, if the shutdown command fails. This avoids leaving the server
      running forever in case something goes wrong with the shutdown
      command.
    - Add debian/patches/fix-configuration.patch to adjust the connection
      configurations used by the tests.
  * Add patch to skip test that makes assumptions about the server side

ruby-mysql2 (0.3.18-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Team upload
  * New upstream release
  * Refresh patches
    - avoid_openssl_loop.patch dropped, applied upstream
    - correct_mysql_init.patch dropped, applied upstream
  * debian/start_mysqld_and_auto_install.sh: skip database creation, since
    mysql seems to already create a database called `test` by default.
    Closes: #791785, #782768
  * add port_to_rspec3.patch, created with `transpec` plus a few manual tweaks
    to port test suite to RSpec3. This was already done upstream, but there
    was no release since then. This patch must probably be dropped when the
    next release comes.

  * Add upstream patch avoid_openssl_loop.patch to use /dev/null in the
    invalidate_fd function to avoid infinite loop in OpenSSL (Closes: #770891)
    Before, a dummy socket was used instead of /dev/null, which may not absorb
    all writes and lead to an infinite loop.
  * Add upstream patch correct_mysql_init.patch to correctly initialize the
    MySQL library, to avoid race condition when other threads try to create a
    connection (Closes: #770896)
